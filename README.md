# cfme-performance
A repo with the goal to provide end-to-end CFME/ManageIQ performance analysis and testing. Browse each folder for more details on how to install, configure, and run each playbook/workload.

## Installing for Testing
```shell
# virtualenv cfme-performance
# cd cfme-performance
# . bin/activate
# git clone https://github.com/akrzos/cfme-performance.git
# cd cfme-performance
# pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```
*Note there are several rpms you may have to install depending on what is already installed in your environment.*


## Major Components
This repo is contains two major components to facilitate its goals:
* [Ansible](#ansible)
* [cfme-performance](#cfme-performance)


### Ansible
[Ansible Playbooks](ansible/)
Ansible playbooks used for deploying and managing infrastructure used in the testing framework.


### cfme-performance
[Python Testing Framework](cfme-performance/)
Testing framework used to run workloads against CFME.

The current workloads are:
* Idle (default, no websocket/git_owner roles, all roles)
* Refresh Providers
* Refresh VMs
* Capacity and Utilization
* Capacity and Utilization with Replication (pglogical and rubyrep)
* SmartState Analysis (Scans VMs)
* Provisioning

In addition to the above workloads, UI Workloads are being built and added as well.  Currently we have one experimental UI Performance workload.
* test_ui_single_page - Produces navigations to the dashboard and back to a single page.

In order to analyze UI performance you must be using Grafana and a patched appliance that has the `statsd_uiworker_patch` applied.  This can be applied via the provided Ansible playbooks.  This will allow you to view page render timings graphed over time in Grafana.
